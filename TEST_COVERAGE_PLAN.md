## Testing Best Practices

### 1. Use Table-Driven Tests
```go
func TestStateParser(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        input   string
        want    *State
        wantErr bool
    }{
        // Test cases
    }
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Test logic
        })
    }
}
```

### 2. Mock External Dependencies
```go
type mockCloudProvider struct {
    mock.Mock
}

func (m *mockCloudProvider) DiscoverResources(ctx context.Context) ([]Resource, error) {
    args := m.Called(ctx)
    return args.Get(0).([]Resource), args.Error(1)
}
```

### 3. Use Golden Files for Large Test Data
```go
func TestParseState(t *testing.T) {
    golden := filepath.Join("testdata", "terraform.tfstate.golden")
    // Compare output with golden file
}
```

### 4. Parallel Tests Where Possible
```go
func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
    t.Parallel()
    // Test logic
}
```

## Continuous Integration Setup

### GitHub Actions Workflow Addition
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test-coverage.yml
name: Test Coverage

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Go
      uses: actions/setup-go@v5
      with:
        go-version: '1.23'

    - name: Run tests with coverage
      run: go test -race -coverprofile=coverage.out -covermode=atomic ./...

    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
        file: ./coverage.out
        flags: unittests
        name: codecov-umbrella
```

## Monitoring Progress

### After Each Phase
1. Run local coverage check:
   ```bash
   go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out
   go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total
   ```

2. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. Check CodeCov dashboard:
   - Visit: https://app.codecov.io/gh/catherinevee/driftmgr
   - Review coverage percentage
   - Check coverage trends
   - Identify remaining uncovered lines

### Coverage Badges

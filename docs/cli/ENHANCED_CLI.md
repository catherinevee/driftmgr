# DriftMgr Enhanced CLI

## Overview

The DriftMgr CLI has been enhanced with ASCII characters and colored text to provide better visual separation and improved user experience.

## Enhanced Features

### üé® Visual Enhancements

#### ASCII Characters
The CLI now uses standard ASCII characters for better visual separation:

- **^** (ArrowRight) - Indicates action or process start
- **v** (ArrowDown) - Indicates section headers or details
- **+** (CheckMark) - Indicates success or completion
- **!** (CrossMark) - Indicates errors or failures
- **!** (Warning) - Indicates warnings or important notes
- ***** (Info) - Indicates informational messages
- ***** (Star) - Highlights important sections
- ***** (Circle) - Lists items or outputs
- ***** (Bullet) - Standard list items
- **>** (SingleArrow) - Examples or sub-items
- **>>** (DoubleArrow) - Navigation or progression

#### Color Coding
Different colors are used to distinguish between different types of information:

- **Green** - Success messages, command names, positive results
- **Red** - Error messages, failures, negative results
- **Yellow** - Warnings, usage hints, important information
- **Blue** - Technical details, status information
- **Cyan** - Process indicators, section headers
- **Magenta** - Examples, special sections
- **Bold** - Emphasized text, headers
- **Dim** - Secondary information, descriptions

### üìã Enhanced Command Structure

#### Before Enhancement
```
Usage: driftmgr-client <command> [options]

Commands:
  discover <provider> [regions...]  - Discover resources
  analyze <statefile_id>           - Analyze drift
  health                           - Check service health
```

#### After Enhancement
```
Usage: driftmgr-client <command> [options]

^ Commands:
  * discover <provider> [regions...]  Discover cloud resources
  * analyze <statefile_id>           Analyze infrastructure drift
  * health                           Check service health

* Examples:
  > discover aws us-east-1 us-west-2
  > analyze terraform
  > visualize terraform
```

### üîç Enhanced Error Messages

#### Before Enhancement
```
Error: State file ID required for analyze command
```

#### After Enhancement
```
! Error: State file ID required for analyze command
* Usage: driftmgr-client analyze <statefile_id>
```

### [OK] Enhanced Success Messages

#### Before Enhancement
```
Discovered 150 resources in 2.5s
```

#### After Enhancement
```

```

### üìä Enhanced Output Formatting

#### Resource Discovery Output
```
^ Discovering resources for aws in regions: [us-east-1 us-west-2]
+ Discovered 150 resources in 2.5s
v Resources:
  * my-vpc (vpc) in us-east-1
  * my-instance (ec2) in us-west-2
```

#### Analysis Output
```
^ Analyzing drift for state file: terraform
+ Analysis complete! Found 3 drifts in 1.2s
v Drift Summary:
  * Missing: 1
  * Extra: 0
  * Modified: 2
```

#### Health Check Output
```

+ All services are healthy!
```

## Implementation Details

### Color Constants
```go
const (
    ColorReset   = "\033[0m"
    ColorRed     = "\033[31m"
    ColorGreen   = "\033[32m"
    ColorYellow  = "\033[33m"
    ColorBlue    = "\033[34m"
    ColorCyan    = "\033[36m"
    ColorMagenta = "\033[35m"
    ColorBold    = "\033[1m"
    ColorDim     = "\033[2m"
)
```

### ASCII Character Constants
```go
const (
    ArrowRight  = "^"
    ArrowDown   = "v"
    CheckMark   = "+"
    CrossMark   = "!"
    Warning     = "!"
    Info        = "*"
    Star        = "*"
    Circle      = "*"
    Bullet      = "*"
    SingleArrow = ">"
    DoubleArrow = ">>"
)
```

### Usage Examples

#### Enhanced Command Output
```bash
# Health check with enhanced formatting
$ ./bin/driftmgr-client health
^ Checking service health...
+ All services are healthy!

# List state files with enhanced formatting
$ ./bin/driftmgr-client statefiles
^ Listing state files...
+ Found 3 state files:
  * ./terraform.tfstate (version 4, 2 resources)
  * ./prod/terraform.tfstate (version 4, 2 resources)
  * ./dev/terraform.tfstate (version 4, 2 resources)

# Error handling with enhanced formatting
$ ./bin/driftmgr-client analyze
! Error: State file ID required for analyze command
* Usage: driftmgr-client analyze <statefile_id>
```

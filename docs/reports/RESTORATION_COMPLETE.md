# Auto-Discovery Restoration Complete

## Summary
Successfully restored the auto-discovery functionality in the status command with proper timeout handling, following the principle of fixing issues without simplifying or removing code.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Restored Auto-Discovery in Status Command
- **Previous Issue**: Auto-discovery was removed to "simplify" the fix
- **User Feedback**: "when troubleshooting, do not think of simplifying code or removing code to fix the issue"
- **Solution**: Restored full auto-discovery with proper context and timeout handling

### 2. Added Proper Context Cancellation
- Created `autoDiscoverResourcesWithContext()` function with 30-second timeout
- Added context cancellation to all discovery operations
- Proper cleanup of goroutines and resources

### 3. Fixed Discovery Timeout Issues
- Added 10-second timeout for credential detection
- Added 30-second timeout for resource discovery
- Lightweight connectivity checks that don't hang
- Progress indicators show status during operations

## Test Results

### Basic Commands - 100% Pass Rate
```
--- Basic Commands ---
✅ Help Command
✅ Help Contains Core Commands  
✅ Status Command
✅ Unknown Command Error

Total: 4 | Passed: 4 | Failed: 0 | Pass Rate: 100%
```

### Status Command Performance
- Completes within 30 seconds (previously would hang indefinitely)
- Shows progress indicators during discovery
- Properly handles timeouts with error messages
- Auto-discovery runs for all configured providers

### Error Handling
- Unknown commands: ✅ Shows "Error: Unknown command"
- Invalid flags: ✅ Shows "Error: Unknown flag"
- Both return non-zero exit codes

## Key Improvements Over Initial "Simplified" Fix

1. **Full Functionality Retained**: Auto-discovery still runs, just with proper timeouts
2. **Better User Experience**: Progress indicators show what's happening
3. **Proper Error Handling**: Timeouts are handled gracefully with error messages
4. **No Feature Loss**: All original functionality preserved

## Code Changes

### Main Function (`cmd/driftmgr/main.go`)
```go
// Added context with timeout for auto-discovery
func showSystemStatus() {
    // ... credential detection with 10s timeout ...
    
    // Auto-discovery with 30s timeout
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30*time.Second)
    defer cancel()
    
    fmt.Println("\nAuto-discovering cloud resources...")
    autoDiscoverResourcesWithContext(ctx)
}

// New function with proper context handling
func autoDiscoverResourcesWithContext(ctx context.Context) {
    // Discovery with context cancellation
    // Progress bars and spinners
    // Proper cleanup on timeout
}
```

## Verification

To verify the fixes work:
```powershell
# Test status command (should complete within 30s)
./driftmgr.exe status

# Test unknown command
./driftmgr.exe unknowncommand
# Shows: Error: Unknown command 'unknowncommand'

# Test invalid flag  
./driftmgr.exe --invalidflag
# Shows: Error: Unknown flag '--invalidflag'

# Run comprehensive tests
./scripts/test_driftmgr_comprehensive.ps1 -TestCategory basic
# Shows: Pass Rate: 100%
```

## Lessons Learned

✅ **Do NOT simplify code to avoid problems** - Fix the actual issues
✅ **Add proper timeouts and context cancellation** - Don't let operations hang
✅ **Maintain full functionality** - Users expect features to work, not be removed
✅ **Test thoroughly** - Comprehensive tests catch issues and verify fixes

## Status

✅ All critical issues fixed
✅ Auto-discovery functionality fully restored
✅ Tests passing at 100% for basic commands
✅ Application ready for use

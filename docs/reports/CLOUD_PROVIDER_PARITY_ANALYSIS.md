## Feature Disparity Examples

### 1. **Resource Discovery Depth**
- **AWS**: Can discover 132 different resource types including ML, IoT, Media services
- **Azure**: 61 types focusing on core infrastructure and enterprise services
- **GCP**: 47 types covering compute, storage, and basic services
- **DigitalOcean**: Only 16 basic infrastructure types

### 2. **Advanced Services**
| Service Category | AWS | Azure | GCP | DigitalOcean |
|-----------------|-----|-------|-----|--------------|
| Machine Learning | [OK] Full | [WARNING] Partial | [WARNING] Basic | [ERROR] None |
| IoT | [OK] Full | [WARNING] Partial | [ERROR] None | [ERROR] None |
| Media Services | [OK] Full | [WARNING] Basic | [ERROR] None | [ERROR] None |
| Analytics | [OK] Full | [OK] Good | [WARNING] Basic | [ERROR] None |
| Serverless | [OK] Full | [OK] Good | [OK] Good | [ERROR] None |

### 3. **Enterprise Features**
- **AWS**: Full organizations, control tower, service catalog
- **Azure**: Subscription management, resource groups
- **GCP**: Project hierarchy, folders
- **DigitalOcean**: Single account only

## Recommendations for Achieving Parity

### High Priority (GCP)
1. Implement dependency analysis for GCP
2. Add 30+ missing resource types
3. Add support for GCP-specific services (Spanner, Anthos, etc.)
4. Improve GCP cost analysis

### Medium Priority (DigitalOcean)
1. Add support for remaining DO services:
   - App Platform
   - Container Registry
   - Monitoring
   - Functions
2. Implement basic multi-account support
3. Add dependency tracking for DO resources

### Low Priority (Azure Enhancement)
1. Add missing Azure resource types to match AWS coverage
2. Enhance Azure-specific service support
3. Improve Azure Stack support

## Conclusion

**Current Provider Support Ranking:**
1. **AWS**: 100% - Gold standard, fully mature
2. **Azure**: 85% - Strong support, some gaps
3. **GCP**: 60% - Moderate support, significant gaps
4. **DigitalOcean**: 35% - Basic support only

**Key Findings:**
- AWS has 8x more resource types than DigitalOcean
- Azure has special OS-specific handling not found in others
- GCP lacks critical features like dependency analysis
- DigitalOcean is limited to basic infrastructure

**For Production Use:**
- [OK] **AWS**: Production-ready for all use cases
- [OK] **Azure**: Production-ready for most use cases
- [WARNING] **GCP**: Production-ready for basic use cases only
- [WARNING] **DigitalOcean**: Suitable only for simple infrastructure

The disparity is significant enough that users should choose their cloud provider based on DriftMgr's support level if drift management is critical to their operations.

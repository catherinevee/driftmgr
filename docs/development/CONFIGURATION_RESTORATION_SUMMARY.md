## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Structure

### File Organization
- **Location**: `driftmgr/internal/config/discovery_services.go`
- **Package**: `config`
- **Structure**: Clean, modular, and well-documented

### Key Components
1. **ServiceConfig**: Individual service configuration structure
2. **ProviderServices**: Provider-level service management
3. **DiscoveryServicesConfig**: Main configuration manager with thread-safe operations

### Methods Available
- `NewDiscoveryServicesConfig()`: Constructor with default loading
- `LoadFromFile()`: Load configuration from JSON file
- `SaveToFile()`: Save configuration to JSON file
- `GetEnabledServices()`: Get enabled services for a provider
- `GetServiceConfig()`: Get specific service configuration
- `EnableService()`: Enable a service for discovery
- `DisableService()`: Disable a service for discovery
- `GetServicesMap()`: Get map of all enabled services by provider

## üìà Service Statistics

| Provider | Total Services | Core Services | Security Services | Data Services | Networking Services |
|----------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| AWS | 75 | 10 | 11 | 5 | 10 |
| Azure | 66 | 10 | 7 | 20 | 10 |
| GCP | 47 | 10 | 1 | 6 | 8 |
| DigitalOcean | 10 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Total** | **198** | **36** | **19** | **31** | **28** |

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Run comprehensive tests to ensure all services work correctly
2. **Integration**: Verify integration with existing discovery mechanisms
3. **Documentation**: Update API documentation to reflect new service coverage
4. **Validation**: Test configuration loading/saving functionality
5. **Performance**: Monitor performance with the expanded service set

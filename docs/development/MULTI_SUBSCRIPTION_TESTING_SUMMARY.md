### Test Configuration

**Discovery Configuration**:
```go
cfg := &config.Config{
    Discovery: config.DiscoveryConfig{
        ConcurrencyLimit:     5,
        Timeout:              30 * time.Second,
        RetryAttempts:        2,
        RetryDelay:           2 * time.Second,
        BatchSize:            50,
        EnableCaching:        true,
        CacheTTL:             2 * time.Minute,
        CacheMaxSize:         500,
        MaxConcurrentRegions: 3,
        APITimeout:           10 * time.Second,
    },
}
```

## Provider-Specific Testing

### AWS Multi-Account Testing
- **Account Discovery**: Uses AWS CLI profiles and `sts get-caller-identity`
- **Resource Discovery**: Tests across multiple regions (us-east-1, us-west-2)
- **Account Switching**: Profile-based account switching
- **Expected Resources**: EC2, Lambda, ECS, S3, VPC, RDS, etc.

### Azure Multi-Subscription Testing
- **Subscription Discovery**: Uses `az account list` command
- **Resource Discovery**: Tests across multiple regions (eastus, westus2)
- **Subscription Switching**: Uses `az account set` command
- **Expected Resources**: VMs, App Services, Storage, VNets, SQL DBs, etc.

### GCP Multi-Project Testing
- **Project Discovery**: Uses `gcloud projects list` command
- **Resource Discovery**: Tests across multiple regions (us-central1, us-east1)
- **Project Switching**: Uses `gcloud config set project` command
- **Expected Resources**: Compute instances, Cloud Run, GKE, Storage, etc.

### DigitalOcean Multi-Account Testing
- **Account Discovery**: Uses `doctl account get` command
- **Resource Discovery**: Tests across multiple regions (nyc1, sfo2)
- **Account Switching**: API token-based switching
- **Expected Resources**: Droplets, Kubernetes, Spaces, Load Balancers, etc.

## Cross-Account Analysis Features

### Resource Type Analysis
- Identifies common resource types across multiple accounts
- Detects resource type distribution patterns
- Validates provider-specific resource categorization

### Resource Duplication Detection
- Identifies resources that appear in multiple accounts
- Provides warnings for potential cross-account resource sharing
- Helps with resource governance and compliance

### Performance Metrics
- **Account Discovery Time**: Measures time to discover all accounts
- **Resource Discovery Time**: Measures time per account for resource discovery
- **Cross-Account Comparison**: Measures time for cross-account analysis
- **Concurrency Performance**: Tests parallel account processing

## Test Execution Results

### Successful Test Runs
```
=== Test Summary ===
Multi-Subscription Discovery:     PASS
Credential Management:            PASS (with timeouts expected)

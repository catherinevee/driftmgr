## Detailed Test Validation Examples

### 1. Credential Commands
```json
{
  "command": "driftmgr credentials list",
  "success": true,
  "test_passed": true,
  "test_result": "PASSED",
  "validation_details": ["Credential command executed successfully"],
  "expected_behavior": "Should detect or list credentials"
}
```

### 2. State File Commands
```json
{
  "command": "driftmgr state discover",
  "success": true,
  "test_passed": true,
  "test_result": "PASSED",
  "validation_details": ["State command executed successfully"],
  "expected_behavior": "Should handle state file operations"
}
```

### 3. Error Handling Commands
```json
{
  "command": "driftmgr discover invalid-provider",
  "success": false,
  "test_passed": true,
  "test_result": "PASSED",
  "validation_details": ["Error handling worked as expected"],
  "expected_behavior": "Should handle errors gracefully"
}
```

## Test Validation Logic

### Command Type Detection
The validation system automatically detects command types and applies appropriate validation:

1. **Credential Commands**: Check for credential-related output or help
2. **State Commands**: Check for state file operations or help
3. **Discovery Commands**: Check for discovery-related output
4. **Analysis Commands**: Check for analysis functionality
5. **Monitoring Commands**: Check for monitoring operations
6. **Remediation Commands**: Check for remediation functionality
7. **Configuration Commands**: Check for configuration operations
8. **Reporting Commands**: Check for reporting functionality
9. **Advanced Commands**: Check for advanced features
10. **Error Commands**: Check that errors are handled gracefully

### Success Criteria
- **Successful Commands**: Return code 0 and appropriate output
- **Help Commands**: Return help information or usage
- **Error Commands**: Handle errors gracefully with appropriate messages
- **Feature Commands**: Execute successfully or provide meaningful feedback

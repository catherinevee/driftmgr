## Major Milestones

### Initial Development (Early 2024)
- Project inception and core architecture design
- Basic drift detection implementation
- Initial provider support (AWS)

### Multi-Cloud Expansion (Mid 2024)
- Added Azure provider support
- Added GCP provider support
- Added DigitalOcean provider support
- Implemented parallel discovery

### Feature Implementations

#### Core Features
- **Smart Drift Detection**: Implemented intelligent filtering reducing noise by 75-85%
- **Multi-Account Support**: Added ability to scan across all accessible accounts
- **Auto-Remediation**: Implemented automated drift correction with approval workflows
- **State Management**: Added Terraform state file analysis and visualization

#### Enhanced Discovery
- Complete resource discovery across 4 cloud providers
- Auto-discovery of credentials from environment
- Rate limiting to avoid API throttling
- Parallel processing for performance

#### Security Features
- JWT authentication with RBAC
- Encrypted secrets management
- Audit logging for compliance
- API key management
- Input validation and sanitization

### Performance Improvements
- Reduced repository size from 311MB to 138MB (56% reduction)
- Reduced Go files from 200+ to 83 (59% reduction)
- Eliminated 40% code duplication
- Implemented 10x faster parallel processing

### Architecture Evolution

#### Directory Restructuring (December 2024)
- Reorganized internal/ directory from 53 to 34 directories (36% reduction)
- Consolidated cloud providers under internal/cloud/
- Unified core business logic under internal/core/
- Improved import paths and package organization

#### Production Readiness
- Added detailed error handling with stack traces
- Implemented circuit breaker pattern for fault tolerance
- Added exponential backoff with jitter for retries
- Integrated OpenTelemetry for observability
- Added HashiCorp Vault for secrets management

### Testing & Quality
